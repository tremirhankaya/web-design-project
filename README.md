# My Personal Web Page / Portfolio

This project is a personal exploration and a practical exercise designed to test and enhance my front-end development skills. It serves as a digital space where I've aimed to reflect my interests and passions through web design and content.

## Project Purpose:

* **Skill Development:** Primarily, this project was built to practice and solidify my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provided an opportunity to experiment with various layout techniques, styling approaches, and interactive elements.
* **Personal Expression:** Beyond technical practice, I wanted to create a website that showcases my hobbies and areas of interest. From articles on topics I find engaging to personal recommendations for games, series, movies, and books, this site is a reflection of my personal space and what excites me.
* **Portfolio Showcase:** As I continue to learn and grow in web development, this project also serves as an early portfolio piece, demonstrating my ability to build a structured, styled, and interactive web presence.

## Technologies Used:

* **HTML5:** For structuring the content.
* **CSS3:** For styling and responsiveness.
* **JavaScript:** For interactive elements and dynamic content handling (e.g., external link redirection, form validation).
* **Bootstrap 4.3.1:** For responsive design and UI components.
* **Font Awesome:** For icons.

## Features:

* **Responsive Navigation:** A clear and intuitive navigation bar to move between sections.
* **Dynamic Content Sections:** Dedicated pages for hobbies (games, series, movies, books) and articles.
* **Interactive Elements:** JavaScript functions for external link redirection and basic client-side form validation.
* **Image Carousel:** A Bootstrap-powered image slider showcasing "Pictures of the Week".
* **Contact Form:** A basic form with client-side validation (note: this form currently uses client-side alerts for submission and does not send emails to a backend).
* **Social Media Links:** Integration of social media profiles.
* **Embedded Map:** A location map is embedded on the contact page.
* **Personal Projects Showcase:** A dedicated section displaying links to other projects.
